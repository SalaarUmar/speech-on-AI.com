<h1>AI/the new normal</h1>
<p>In the name of Allah, the most compassionate the most merciful. Respected judges and my dear fellows,</p>
<p>Assalam-o-Alaikum!</p>
<p>My self Salaar Umar and I am from grade 9</p>
<p>Today, I want to talk about something that is rapidly shaping our world — Artificial Intelligence, or as we now call it, the new normal.</p>
<p>AI is no longer a concept from science fiction. It's here, and it's woven into our everyday lives. From voice assistants that help us manage our schedules, to algorithms that suggest what we watch, read, or buy — AI is everywhere. It's changing how we work, learn, communicate, and even think.</p>
<p>Honorable judges!<br> Think about it — when you ask Siri a question, when Netflix recommends your next show, and when your phone unlocks with your face — that's AI in action. It’s not just in big tech labs; it’s in our pockets, our homes, and even our schools. It’s quietly reshaping the way we live — often without us even realizing it.</p>
<p>In healthcare, AI helps doctors diagnose diseases faster and more accurately. In education, it's personalizing learning. In business, it's optimizing operations and decision-making. And in creative fields, it's opening up entirely new ways to express ideas.</p>
<p>AI can compose music, write poems, design graphics, and even code websites. It’s like having a digital assistant with limitless imagination — and it's only getting smarter.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">“From logic deep to visions grand,<br>
AI lends us a helping hand.”
</p>
<p>Respected judges!<br> 
Transportation is another field experiencing transformation. Self-driving cars and smart traffic systems are no longer distant dreams — they're becoming reality. AI is also helping farmers increase crop yields, aiding disaster response teams with early detection systems, and assisting people with disabilities through accessible technologies.
</p>
<p>It’s amazing to see how many lives are being improved through innovation — but with this new normal comes responsibility. We
must ensure that AI is used ethically, inclusively, and transparently. It should empower people — not replace them.
</p>
<p>We also need to ask important questions: Are we using AI to solve real problems? Are we protecting people’s privacy and rights? Are we ensuring fairness and preventing bias?</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">“With power comes a heavy load,<br>
Let’s choose the right and mindful road.”</p>
<p>Esteemed judges!<br> 
We must remember: AI learns from us — from our data, our decisions, our behaviors. If we feed it bias, it will reflect bias. If we train it with fairness and integrity, it will serve as a fair and helpful tool. So the question isn't just what AI can do, but what values we want it to carry.
</p>
<p>Let us embrace this technology, not with fear, but with awareness, curiosity, and a shared commitment to using it wisely. Because when guided by the right hands, AI can be a powerful ally.</p>
<p>AI isn’t just the future — it’s the present. And together, we must shape it into a force for good.</p>
<p>And as we step into this world of digital intelligence, let’s not forget our own human intelligence — our compassion, our ethics, our values. These are things no machine can ever replace.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">“Machines may guide,but hearts must steer,<br>
With kindness, truth, and vision clear.”
</p>
<p>Let us be the generation that uses AI not only for what it can do, but for what it can mean — to uplift, to inspire, and to bring positive change in the world.</p>
<p>Honorable judges!<br> 
Let’s educate ourselves and others not just to use AI, but to understand it, to improve it, and to lead it in the right direction. Let’s innovate with conscience, build with responsibility, and dream with purpose.
</p>
<p>Because the future will not be written by machines alone — it will be written by us, with the help of machines.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">“The future’s written line by line,<br>
With code and care, your heart and mine.”
</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
